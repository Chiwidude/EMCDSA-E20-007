########### Exploratory Data Analysis ###############
# this project will cover
# importing and exporing in R
# basic data types and operations
# generating descriptive statistics such as summaryu() function, it will help to analyse Magnitude and Range of the data
# but other operations such as linear relationships, distributions are more difficult to see from descriptive statistics 


#to detect the pattners and anomalies of the data we need
#exploratory data analysis with visulaization
# visulaization will gives us succint and holistic view of the data
# an imp facet of the initial data exploration, visulaization assesses
# data cleanliness and suggests potentially important relationship 
# in the data prior to the model planning and building phases
